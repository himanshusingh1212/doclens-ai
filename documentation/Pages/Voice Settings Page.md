## Purpose

The **Voice Settings Page** manages the Text-to-Speech (TTS) subsystem. It configures default speech output engines, handles Piper neural voice models, controls playback speed and pitch, and hosts the browser-native Web Speech API voice selection inventory.

## Layout Overview

Organized in a single column (`max-w-4xl`) for linear settings configuration (Language → Engine → Voice → Speed/Pitch).
