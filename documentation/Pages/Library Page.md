## Purpose

The **Library Page** is the application's central entry point. It serves as the dashboard where users can upload new PDFs, view their collection of stored documents, check AI processing status, and delete records.

## Layout Structure

The layout utilizes a two-column setup where the left column is the fixed-width [[SidebarLayout]] navigation panel and the right column is a scrollable container with a responsive layout grid.

## Technical Features & State Management

- **Session Continuity (Cold Launch Auto-Restore):** Checks `sessionStorage` on mount. If a document was open during the last session, the page automatically redirects the user back to that document in the [[Workspace Page]] to preserve context.
- **Async Storage:** Documents are retrieved from [[IndexedDB Storage]] using React state.
- **Responsive Navigation:** Renders a hamburger menu on mobile which toggles the navigation panel drawer.

## Relationships

- **Workflow:** Ingests documents and hands them to the [[PDF to Translation Workflow]].
- **Team Ownership:** Owned by [[Squad A — PDF Extraction]].
- **Key Component:** [[DocumentCard]], [[Dropzone]].
