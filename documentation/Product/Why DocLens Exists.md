## The Problem

Millions of PDF documents — textbooks, research papers, legal contracts, government forms — are published in languages the reader doesn't speak. Existing solutions have critical gaps:

| Existing Approach | Limitation |
|------------------|------------|
| Google Translate (web) | Copy-paste workflow, loses document structure, no offline |
| Adobe Acrobat | No AI translation, expensive, cloud-dependent |
| ChatGPT / Claude | Manual copy-paste per page, no document-native UX, data leaves device |
| DeepL | No PDF viewer, no TTS, no per-page control |

## The Vision

A **single tool** where users can:
1. Open a PDF document
2. See the original alongside an AI translation or explanation
3. Listen to the result in a natural-sounding voice
4. Do all of this **privately, in their browser**, with no data leaving their device

---

## Design Principles

1. **Privacy by default** — All PDF processing is local. The AI key lives on the server; documents never leave the browser.
2. **Offline-capable** — PDF viewing and TTS work without internet once voices are cached.
3. **Language-first** — The UI prioritizes language selection. Indian languages appear in native scripts, not romanized.
4. **Progressive complexity** — Simple for first-time users (auto-detect model, one-click translate), powerful for developers (JSON editor, per-page overrides, memory diagnostics).
5. **Ebook-like reading** — Auto-translate and sentence-level TTS highlighting create an immersive reading experience, not a translation utility.
