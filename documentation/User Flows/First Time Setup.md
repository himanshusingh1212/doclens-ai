- Language persists to `localStorage` immediately

### 4. Select AI Model
- On the same [[General Settings Page]], scroll to Model Selection
- Default tab: "free" — shows zero-cost models for experimentation
- Click a model card to select it
- Related feature: [[AI Translation]]

### 5. (Optional) Install a Voice
